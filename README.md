In my profile you can find more information about the technologies I have been working with. Because I am constantly acquiring knowledge on new technologies my profile will be updated frequently. Currently I am working on [the Cake-shop app](https://github.com/katerynapidhorna/cake-shop) with [Emnet](https://github.com/Emnetdegafe) and [Kate](https://github.com/katerynapidhorna)
